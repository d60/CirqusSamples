# ToDoomList

A to-doom list is a way of keeping track of your evil plans.

The sample is a console application that can run in two flavors: One for MSSQL and one for MongoDB.

You must comment code in/out in order to pick your flavor.

Connection strings for the two flavors can be found in `app.config` - please not that you must go and create an appropriate database on your SQL Server for the MSSQL variant to work.
